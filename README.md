# Here I try a new setup for ES lint

It should be applied later to a bigger TypeScript Project.
I am testing different configurations.

### Setup:

**install** ES lint:

```shell
npm init @eslint/config@latest
```

follow the **instructions**:

```shell
Need to install the following packages:
@eslint/create-config@1.6.0
Ok to proceed? (y) <ins>y</ins>


> npx
> create-config

@eslint/create-config: v1.6.0

The config that you've selected requires the following dependencies:

eslint, globals, @eslint/js, typescript-eslint, eslint-plugin-react
‚úî Would you like to install them now? ¬∑ No / <ins>Yes</ins>

‚òïÔ∏èInstalling...

Successfully created /Path/ES-Lint-Config/eslint.config.mjs file.
```

if its not applied correctly in your **tsx** files you can try:

```shell
npm install --save-dev eslint eslint-plugin-react @typescript-eslint/parser @typescript-eslint/eslint-plugin
```

#### It creates 2 files, eslint.config.mjs and eslint.config.js

I used the mjs for configuration (ECMAScript-module)

**mjs file**: This file uses ESM (ECMAScript Modules), and since ESLint now supports ESM, this configuration is best for modern projects.

**js file**: The js file is used for CommonJS, which may be necessary in older projects or certain environments.

FYI:
ESLint is aligned with modern JavaScript standards, and ESM is preferred in the long term.

‚úÖ Advantages of ESM (.mjs):
‚úî Better performance (tree-shaking, optimized imports)
‚úî Import syntax (import ... from instead of require(...))
Future-proof (Node.js and modern tools rely on ESM)

‚õî CommonJS (.js with module.exports) will be phased out in the long term.

**deleted the js file**

#### to run it:

```shell
npx eslint "src/**/*.{js,jsx,ts,tsx}"
```

#### If it autocorrects in VS Code:

How do I change the behaviour in VS Code?

If ESLint automatically corrects the behaviour in VS Code, this is probably due to the settings.

1Ô∏è‚É£ Open the settings (Ctrl + ,)
2Ô∏è‚É£ Search for "editor.codeActionsOnSave"
3Ô∏è‚É£ If you see that ESLint automatically corrects when saving, you can deactivate it:

üëâ If ESLint should not autocorrect, set it like this:

```json
"editor.codeActionsOnSave": {
  "source.fixAll.eslint": false
}
```

üëâ If you only want it to display but not automatically correct, remove "source.fixAll.eslint" : true.

#### Or run ES lint for one file

```shell
npx eslint src/FileName.tsx
```
